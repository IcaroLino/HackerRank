/*
 * Write a program that creates or splits Camel Case variable, method, and class names.
 *
 * Each line of the input file will begin with an operation (S or C) followed by a semi-colon
 * followed by M, C, or V followed by a semi-colon followed by the words you'll need to operate on.
 *
 * The operation will either be S (split) or C (combine).
 * M indicates method, C indicates class, and V indicates variable.
 *
 * In the case of a split operation, the words will be a camel case method, class or variable name
 * that you need to split into a space-delimited list of words starting with a lowercase letter.
 *
 * In the case of a combine operation, the words will be a space-delimited list of words starting
 * with lowercase letters that you need to combine into the appropriate camel case String.
 * Methods should end with an empty set of parentheses to differentiate them from variable names.
