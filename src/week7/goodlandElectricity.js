/**
 * Goodland is a country with a number of evenly spaced cities along a line.
 * The distance between adjacent cities is 1 unit.
 * Find the fewest number of power plants needed to provide electricity to the entire list.
 * Determine that number. If it cannot be done, return -1.
 *
 * Given a list of city data. Cities that may contain a power plant have been labeled 1.
 * Others not suitable for building a plant are labeled 0.
 * Given a distribution range of k,
 * find the lowest number of plants that must be built such that all cities are served.
 * The distribution range limits supply to cities where distance is less than k.
 *
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
 * The function accepts following parameters:
 *  1. INTEGER k
 *  2. INTEGER_ARRAY arr
