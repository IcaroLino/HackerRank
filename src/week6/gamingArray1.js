/**
 * Andy wants to play a game with his little brother, Bob.
 * The game starts with an array of distinct integers and the rules are as follows:
 * Bob always plays first.
 * In a single move, a player chooses the maximum element in the array.
 * He removes it and all elements to its right.
 * The two players alternate turns.
 * The last player who can make a move wins.
 *
 * Given the initial array for each game, find and print the name of the winner on a new line.
 * If Andy wins, print ANDY; if Bob wins, print BOB.
 *
 * The function is expected to return a STRING.
 * The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.
