/**
 * We define super digit of an integer x using the following rules:
 *
 * Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.
 * If x has only 1 digit, then its super digit is x.
 * Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.
 *
 * The number p is created by concatenating the string n k times.
 *
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
 * The function accepts following parameters:
 *  1. STRING n
 *  2. INTEGER k
