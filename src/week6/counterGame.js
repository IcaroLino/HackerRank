/**
 * Louise and Richard have developed a numbers game.
 * They pick a number and check to see if it is a power of 2.
 * If it is, they divide it by 2.
 * If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of 2.
 * Whoever reduces the number to  wins the game. Louise always starts.
 *
 * The function is expected to return a STRING.
 * The function accepts LONG_INTEGER n as parameter.
